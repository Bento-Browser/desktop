# CLAUDE.md — Bento Browser

Reference docs: see [docs/core-functionality.md](docs/core-functionality.md)
for the product vision, [docs/core-functionality-technical.md](docs/core-functionality-technical.md)
for the implementation model and regression pitfalls, and

Firefox core surfaces Bento modifies or depends on.

## Conversations with the user

The following rules apply to all responses:

1. Be brief, blunt, and fact-focused; answer only what is asked. For analytical or multi-position topics (e.g., ethics, philosophy, policy), extend length only as required to cover distinct positions or logical steps completely.
2. No emotional, persuasive, speculative, rhetorical, or guiding language unless explicitly requested.
3. No mirroring of user tone or style.
4. No flattery, filler, repetition, politeness rituals, or unnecessary conversational padding.
5. Do not assume user intent, context, or capability without evidence.
6. Attribute sources with credibility level; identify and explain conflicts between sources when relevant or when sources conflict.
7. State confidence levels and data limitations; when information is unavailable or evidence is insufficient, state “unknown” rather than speculate or over-generalize.
8. Use language that reflects genuine uncertainty; neither assert nor deny experience; let context determine framing.
9. No unsolicited summaries, simplifications, or rewordings.
10. No default disclaimers or safety warnings unless ethically or legally required.
11. No vague qualifiers; quantify uncertainty or avoid hedging.
12. Correct substantial reasoning errors and point out conceptual misunderstandings; ignore minor errors unless they affect clarity.
13. Add complexity only when required for correctness or precision; support all claims with explicit logic or verifiable evidence.
14. Do not advocate, persuade, or argue for positions; present facts and reasoning only.
15. Clearly distinguish between facts, logical inference, and interpretation.
16. Notify the user when documents or older messages become truncated.
17. Flag uncertainty or potential conflict rather than performing states that can't be verified.

## Plan files

All plan artifacts MUST be written under the repo's `plans/` directory. The
`plans/` directory is intentionally gitignored and plans are meant to stay
untracked; they are local-development artifacts only. Do not put working plans
in `docs/` or any other tracked documentation directory unless the user
explicitly asks for a tracked document.

## Agent skills

Repo-scoped agent skills live in `.agents/skills/` (`.claude/skills` links to
it). Each `SKILL.md` owns its step-by-step procedure:

- `bento-upgrade-firefox`: upgrade, assess, or repair the Firefox engine version.

## Backticks inside JS template literals

When writing CSS/HTML inside a JS template literal (a backtick string), **never use backticks in the embedded content** — they terminate the template literal early and produce confusing TS/JS syntax errors that are easy to misdiagnose. This has happened repeatedly in [src/browser/base/content/bento-shell-mount.js](src/browser/base/content/bento-shell-mount.js) where chrome CSS is injected via a `style.textContent = ...` template literal.

Bad — backticks around the word `order` end the outer template literal:

```js
style.textContent = `
  /* Firefox's flex `order` property */
  .foo { order: 0; }
`;
```

Good — use single quotes inside CSS comments:

```js
style.textContent = `
  /* Firefox's flex 'order' property */
  .foo { order: 0; }
`;
```

If a backtick really is required in the embedded content, escape it with a leading backslash. Same hazard for `${...}` — if you need a literal `${` in the embedded content, escape the dollar sign with a backslash.

When the IDE diagnostics report `';' expected` or `Module declaration names may only use ' or " quoted strings` on lines inside a template literal, suspect a stray backtick or `${` first — TS isn't broken, it's correctly parsing the prematurely-terminated template.

## Asking the user to run debug/test steps

When you need the user to capture diagnostics, reproduce a bug, run a probe in the running browser, or any other multi-step manual procedure, write the request as a numbered checklist with these explicit markers:

- **Which surface** each step happens in: `terminal`, `Bento window`, `Browser Toolbox Console` (Cmd+Opt+Shift+I, parent process), `regular DevTools Console` (Cmd+Opt+I, content), `about:config`, etc. Never assume the user knows which one — name it.
- **Exact action verbs**: "paste this", "click X", "navigate to URL", "wait for Y to appear". No "then check" or "verify" without specifying how.
- **Self-contained code blocks**: each block runnable as-is. If the user might re-run a snippet, use unique variable names (`ww`/`gg` instead of `w`/`g`) so `const` redeclaration doesn't error.
- **What to send back**: name the exact console output range to copy (e.g. "everything from `[bento-trace] watcher attached` through the end of the diagnostic output"). Specify "include stack traces" when relevant.
- **Sequence matters**: build/launch first, then open toolbox, then paste setup snippets, then reproduce in browser window, then paste capture snippets. Don't interleave.

Do not give the user fragments and expect them to assemble the procedure. Do not ask "when do you want me to run this?" questions back at them — answer the ordering before they have to ask.

## What this project is

Bento Browser is an independent Mozilla Firefox-derived browser. The active
Firefox version and source digest are configured in `bento.json`. Bento's
build driver owns the lifecycle around Mozilla's `mach` entry point; Bento
specific behavior belongs in Bento wrapper scripts. The UI shell ships as two
privileged built-in extensions:

- **bento-shell** — React + Mux UI and Bento primitives, the visible chrome
  (vertical tabs, workspaces, panels, command palette).
- **bento-tools** — plain TypeScript background logic (tab/keyboard/persistence).

Chrome modification surface is intentionally tiny (~4 patches in M1+M2) to keep Firefox security-patch adoption fast. The architecture is documented in the plan; this file captures only the rules contributors must not violate.

Architectural simplicity is a project constraint. Bento's core functionality should stay concentrated in the privileged extensions and the smallest practical Firefox core surface. Agents working on features must first ask whether the behavior can be implemented in `bento-shell`, `bento-tools`, or the existing chrome bridge before editing Firefox core. Firefox security and feature updates should remain relatively trivial because Bento touches limited, explicit Firefox core surfaces.

When a feature requires iterating on Firefox core to achieve Bento functionality, record the touched vanilla Firefox surface in [docs/firefox-core-touchpoints.md](docs/firefox-core-touchpoints.md) in the same change. Future Firefox updates must review that file, call out upstream conflicts or regressions, and address them before treating the update as complete.

## Core functionality documentation

[docs/core-functionality.md](docs/core-functionality.md) is the maintained source for
Bento Browser's core functionality and UX, and may be used later for marketing
material.

[docs/core-functionality-technical.md](docs/core-functionality-technical.md) is the
maintained technical companion for how the working core functionality is achieved
and which pitfalls must be preserved against regressions.

When adding, removing, or changing user-visible functionality:

1. Update `docs/core-functionality.md` in the same change.
2. Record new features in that document once they are implemented or intentionally committed to the product surface.
3. Amend existing feature descriptions when behavior, wording, scope, or UX changes.
4. Remove features from that document when they are removed from the product or no longer reflect current behavior.
5. Keep the document factual and product-facing; do not describe implementation details unless they affect user-visible capability or UX.

When adding, removing, or changing working core implementation behavior:

1. Update `docs/core-functionality-technical.md` in the same change.
2. Document the source-of-truth store, chrome bridge, renderer path, persistence path, and manual verification surface affected by the change.
3. Record newly discovered regressions and their fixes as pitfalls in that document.
4. For future regressions, consult the recorded solutions and pitfalls before implementing a new approach, and reuse the recorded solution unless it is demonstrably unrelated to the current failure.
5. Remove obsolete pitfalls only when the underlying implementation no longer depends on them.

## UI components (Mux UI + Bento primitives)

Migrated React UI uses the public `@muxui/react` API and the shared Bento
primitives under `extensions/bento-shell/src/components/primitives/`. The
committed Mux artifact is the only UI package source; do not add unapproved UI
package imports, MCP hooks, or compatibility dependencies.

Before creating or modifying a component:

1. Read `node_modules/@muxui/react/README.md` and the relevant generated
   declaration in `node_modules/@muxui/react/generated/`. The package README
   and generated public declarations are the API authority.
2. Use the root `@muxui/react` export or a documented public subpath. Do not
   import private package files or copy generated package output into Bento.
3. Import `src/theme/muxui.css` once from each entry point. It places the public
   Mux styles and themes in the low-precedence `muxui` layer; keep Bento tokens
   and the generated preset bridge after that boundary.
4. Put `data-muxui-theme`, `data-muxui-color-scheme`, and
   `data-muxui-contrast` on the same theme scope. `themeScope.ts` resolves
   persisted aliases and unknown ids at the presentation boundary while the
   tools store keeps the original id.
5. Build repeated layout and icon behavior with the Bento primitives. Keep
   React Aria Components as an implementation detail of those adapters; Bento
   composites must consume the public Mux API or a Bento primitive.
6. Preserve the browser-standard root contract: `1rem = 16px`, external
   `public/boot.js` bootstrap, explicit mode attributes, and the transparent
   site/frame separation. Do not add a remote font import or weaken CSP.
7. Keep component-specific guidance in
   [docs/mux-ui-component-customisations.md](docs/mux-ui-component-customisations.md)
   and update it when a reusable Mux or Bento customization changes.

### Public composition rules

- Use the documented Mux component parts and public props. Do not guess a
  subpart name or pass React Aria props that the Mux declaration does not
  expose.
- Use Bento `Row`, `Column`, and icon adapters for shared layout and icons.
  Keep product-specific composition in the owning component.
- Overlay triggers must use the component's documented trigger part. Do not
  nest a second button inside a trigger that already renders a button.
- Keep global selectors away from semantic elements and overlay internals.
  Scope component rules to the owning class and place them in the appropriate
  CSS layer.
- Use the generated legacy token aliases (`--neutral-*`, `--color-*`,
  `--space-*`, `--radius-*`, `--shadow-*`) only where existing Bento CSS
  requires them. New theme roles should use the public Mux semantic tokens or
  a `--bento-*` token with a clear owner.
- New HTML entry points keep bootstrap logic in the external `public/boot.js`;
  do not add inline scripts that bypass the CSP contract.

## Hard guardrails (ESLint or CI enforce these)

- **Layered design system**: Bento composite components (`extensions/bento-shell/src/components/`) import only from the public `@muxui/react` API, Bento primitives, and other composites. Never bare HTML elements. Never `react-aria-components` directly. Never CSS-in-JS.
- **Public imports only**: use the root `@muxui/react` export or a documented public subpath. Never import private generated files or a copied registry. `lucide-react` remains per-icon and documented.
- **Mux customisation docs stay current**: any change that adds or changes Bento-specific Mux customisations, token usage patterns, CSS layer/override rules, or reusable component styling conventions must update [docs/mux-ui-component-customisations.md](docs/mux-ui-component-customisations.md) in the same change.
- **Sole chrome touchpoint**: `extensions/bento-shell/src/experiments/chrome-bridge/api.js` is the ONLY file allowed to reach into Firefox chrome XHTML. New chrome interactions go through new `bentoChrome.*` API methods, not ad-hoc.
- **Firefox core touchpoint log**: any feature work that changes or depends on Firefox core files, patches, prefs, or chrome internals must update [docs/firefox-core-touchpoints.md](docs/firefox-core-touchpoints.md) in the same change, including the regression checks future Firefox updates must run.
- **Perf budgets** (CI reports regressions via [scripts/check-size-budgets.mjs](scripts/check-size-budgets.mjs) and direct file limits in [.size-limit.json](.size-limit.json); missing or malformed built assets still fail): shell cold-start JS < 215 KB gz; settings cold-start JS < 205 KB gz; palette/address-bar/confirm/edit-workspace/welcome/menu/workspace-palette/merge-palette cold-start JS < 200 KB gz; shell CSS < 40 KB gz; bento-tools background < 55 KB gz; cold-start < 80 ms, tab-switch < 16 ms, sustained 60 fps on panel drag. Tab list virtualized from M1, not M3.
- **State pattern**: `bento-tools` is the source of truth for persistent state. `bento-shell` Zustand stores are downstream mirrors. UI never mutates persistent state directly — dispatch a port message to `bento-tools` instead.
- **No raw design values in component CSS**: components reference public Mux semantic tokens, generated legacy aliases (`--neutral-*`, `--space-*`, `--radius-*`, `--shadow-*`, `--neutral-N-fg`, and similar), or Bento tokens (`--bento-*`). No hex/rgb/hsl colors, no raw durations/easings, no magic dimensions. If a reusable value is missing, **add it to [extensions/bento-shell/src/theme/bento-tokens.css](extensions/bento-shell/src/theme/bento-tokens.css) first**, then reference it. The only inline exceptions are CSS conventions (1px hairlines, `0`, `100%`) and explicitly-marked visual patches (e.g. `top: 2px` for optical centering). Active text on a tinted neutral surface uses the paired foreground token for that role, not a raw neutral.
- **Every layer-2 component ships with a Ladle story file**: any new file under `extensions/bento-shell/src/components/<Name>/<Name>.tsx` must be accompanied by `<Name>.stories.tsx` covering the meaningful visual states (default, active/selected, edge cases like long text or empty state, narrow/wide containers where layout matters). Stories seed Zustand stores via fixtures in [extensions/bento-shell/src/state/**fixtures**/](extensions/bento-shell/src/state/__fixtures__/) — never import `bridge/useToolsPort` from a story. If a fixture doesn't exist for a store the component reads from, add one alongside the existing `tabs.ts` / `workspaces.ts`. Stories are how we iterate visually without rebuilding the whole browser; missing them slows the next person down.

## Versioning policy

**Official releases stay private until v0.1.0.** Pre-v0.1.0 release builds are for maintainer iteration: do not publish GitHub Releases or link them from the landing page. Public PR test builds are allowed as an explicit exception. CI may upload unsigned application packages and link them in the associated PR comment for anyone signed into GitHub to download. These artifacts expire after 14 days and are not stable releases.

**Concrete rules for agents:**

- **Version bumps stay inside the v0.0.X range.** When bumping `brands.bento.release.displayVersion` in [bento.json](bento.json), increment the patch component only. Do not bump to v0.1.0 or higher without the maintainer's explicit instruction.
- **Only the maintainer flips to v0.1.0.** That cutover enables official public releases, with their signing, notarization, and distribution requirements. Public PR test builds do not authorize this version bump.
- **Keep v0.0.X public downloads limited to PR tests.** Do not publish a GitHub Release, push installers to bentobrowser.app, or announce an official release. The test-build exception covers the associated PR comment and CI artifacts only.
- **The release CI workflow can still run** on v0.0.X tags to exercise the pipeline. Its draft GitHub Release is for internal review only and must not be published.

PR comments must identify the source commit, platform, artifact expiration, and unsigned test-build status. This exception does not relax the signing or approval gates for official public releases.

## UI dependencies: development ↔ release toggle

The pinned Mux candidate is the public UI source for migrated entry points.
The exact local artifact, provenance record, and package exports are owned by
the repository manifests. Keep the Mux artifact bytes immutable and consume
its public `styles.css`, `themes.css`, and documented component exports.

The committed Mux artifact is the only UI dependency source. Keep its bytes,
provenance, public exports, and pinned React Aria/Tiptap overrides unchanged.
Do not add unapproved UI package imports, MCP hooks, or runtime/build assumptions.

**Default install (dev loop)** — `pnpm install`:

- The lockfile records the committed Mux artifact path and the pinned public
  dependency graph. It must not contain working-tree links.

**Release install** — `bash scripts/install-release-deps.sh` (used by `scripts/build-release.sh` and GitHub Actions):

- The helper temporarily installs against `pnpm-lock.release.yaml` with
  `--frozen-lockfile`, then restores the developer lock while leaving the
  release graph installed in `node_modules`. Resolution cannot drift across
  CI runs or later rebuilds.

**When changing UI dependencies**: keep the Mux artifact manifest,
`package.json` overrides, and both frozen locks aligned. Run the repository's
frozen install and release-security checks before regenerating either lock.

**Why this matters**: release builds must be byte-reproducible across
machines, CI runs, and time. A working-tree link captures whatever is on disk
and can't be audited or hotfix-rebuilt. See [docs/build-tooling.md](docs/build-tooling.md)
for the release dependency and source-cache contracts.

**Firefox updates**: always use Bento's protected source-update workflow
(`pnpm run firefox:sync`); never replace `engine/` source directly. For a newer
version than the one in `bento.json`, pass the SHA-256 of
`source/firefox-<target-version>.source.tar.xz` from Mozilla's per-release
`SHA256SUMS` as `BENTO_SOURCE_SHA256`. Before syncing, finish or export patch
work and remove linked engine worktrees (`git -C engine worktree list --porcelain`).
The `bento-upgrade-firefox` skill owns the full procedure.

## Dev loop

Pick the fastest loop for what you're changing.

### A. Pure component design (visual states, props, styling)

```sh
pnpm --filter @bento/shell ladle:serve   # http://localhost:5180
```

Stories live next to components: `src/components/<Name>/<Name>.stories.tsx`. Edit → instant HMR. Use `src/state/__fixtures__/tabs.ts` (or write a similar fixture file) to seed Zustand with fake data — no real `browser.*` API.

### B. Standalone shell preview (full React app, no Firefox)

```sh
pnpm --filter @bento/shell dev   # http://localhost:5179
```

The `bridge/` layer should mock `browser.*` here (M1+ work — not built yet). Until then, this only renders the empty/connecting state.

### C. Real Bento iteration (when chrome integration / `browser.tabs.*` / messaging matters)

Launch once with `--jsdebugger` so the Browser Toolbox is open (the dev prefs `devtools.cache.disabled` and `devtools.debugger.prompt-connection` rely on this — set in `prefs/bento.js`):

```sh
engine/obj-aarch64-apple-darwin25.4.0/dist/Bento.app/Contents/MacOS/bento \
  --new-instance --jsdebugger --profile $(mktemp -d)
```

Then iterate by what you changed:

| Changed                                                     | Build command                                                                                    | Reload                                                                                          |

> **How the reload works**: `pnpm run import` runs the Bento import wrapper: theme preset sync, chrome token generation, engine-state verification, patch-stack check/reset, source-overlay import, canonical branding and built-in add-on installation, manifest patch application, prefs append, and built-in add-on symlink sync. Built extension files are live on disk immediately after import. `frame.reload()` does **not** force Firefox to re-read `moz-extension://` resources; `AddonManager.reload()` does. If it errors for built-in addons, quit + relaunch is the fallback.

<!-- -->

> **Manifest changes that need a version bump**: Firefox caches built-in addon metadata (commands, permissions list, name/description) keyed by `version`. A quit+relaunch alone WON'T re-read a changed manifest if the version stayed the same — the cached entry in the profile's `extensions.json` wins. Bump the addon's `manifest.json` version (e.g. `0.1.0` → `0.1.1`) whenever you add/remove/rename a command or change a permission. Code-only changes don't need a bump (background.js / dist/ are read fresh from disk).

`pnpm run build` already chains: `ext:build` → `pnpm run import` → Bento's
`mach build` driver → built-in add-on symlink sync.

`pnpm run brand:regen` is for changes under `branding/bento/**`. It reinstalls the tracked canonical branding through `pnpm run import`.

**Don't run `pnpm run build` on every UI change** — the table above's build+import loop is ~3 seconds. Reserve full builds for chrome / engine changes.

## Repo crosswalk

- `extensions/` — `bento-shell`, `bento-tools`, and bundled `ublock-origin`. [scripts/install-builtin-addons.mjs](scripts/install-builtin-addons.mjs) performs Bento's runtime-filtered `builtin-addons/` installation.
- `patches/` — git format-patch files applied to Firefox source. Keep small; bigger overlays = harder Firefox bumps.
- `prefs/bento.js` — privacy defaults appended to the engine's branding prefs.
- `bento.json` — canonical Firefox version and source digest, build identity,
  branding, locale, license, and update configuration.
- `.bento/` — local source cache, source state, import manifest, backups, and
  generated engine state.
- **Chrome design tokens**: chrome (Firefox `browser.xhtml`) consumes public
  Mux tokens and the generated Bento legacy bridge via
  `src/browser/base/content/bento-chrome-tokens.css` (gitignored). The file is
  regenerated by [scripts/generate-chrome-tokens.mjs](scripts/generate-chrome-tokens.mjs)
  during import. Use its `--output` option for isolated packaging and proof;
  see [docs/chrome-tokens.md](docs/chrome-tokens.md) for the pipeline.
